# Programming-and-Algorithm-Questions

## This repository contains programming interview questions. The solution for these questions are coded in C and Java programming languages.

### 1. Way to compile and run C pograms on Linux
#### a. Compile the C-program using "gcc program_name.c -o program_name.o"
#### b. Execute the C-program using "./program_name.o"

### 2. Way to compile and run Java pograms
#### a. Compile the java program using "javac program_name.java". IF the compilation is successfull then in the same directory a program_name.class file will be generated.
#### b. Execute the java class file using "java -enableassertions program_name/java -ea program_name". The '-enableassertions/-ea' flag is used to enable the assertions used in the java program which are disabled by default.
